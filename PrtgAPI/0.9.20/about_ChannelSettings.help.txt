SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes PRTG Channel properties that can be used in conjunction with Set-ChannelProperty.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PrtgAPI supports the retrieval and modification of Channel Setting values in a reliable, typesafe manner.
    The following table outlines the properties that are currently supported/unsupported by PrtgAPI.

    In the tables below, the following keys are used to indicate typesafe support status.

    Yes       : Supported
    No        : Not currently supported

    Set-ChannelProperty does not currently support the modification of raw channel properties. As such, any
    properties not listed as supported in the table below cannot currently be interfaced with in the desired
    manner by PrtgAPI.

    | Property              | Get | Set | Description                                                             |

    | ValueMode             |    Yes    | How data is grouped together in historical graphs                       |
    | DecimalMode           |    Yes    | How the number of decimal places to display is determined               |
    | DecimalPlaces         |    Yes    | Number of decimal places to display when DecimalMode is Custom          |
    | SpikeFilterEnabled    |    Yes    | Whether to truncate invalid values to within expected ranges            |
    | SpikeFilterMax        |    Yes    | Upper value limit. High values will be reduced to this threshold        |
    | SpikeFilterMin        |    Yes    | Lower value limit. Low values will be increased to this threshold       |

    | UpperWarningLimit     |    Yes    | Upper limit for entering this channel's sensor into a warning state     |
    | LowerErrorLimit       |    Yes    | Lower limit for entering this channel's sensor into an error state      |
    | LowerWarningLimit     |    Yes    | Lower limit for entering this channel's sensor into a warning state     |
    | ErrorLimitMessage     |    Yes    | Message to display when upper or lower error limit is met               |
    | WarningLimitMessage   |    Yes    | Message to display when upper or lower warning limit is met             |

EXAMPLES
    Set the UpperErrorLimit of the "Total" channel to 90 on all WMI CPU Load sensors


    C:\> Get-Sensor -Tags wmicpuloadsensor | Get-Channel Total | Set-ChannelProperty UpperErrorLimit 90
